Things to note!
- Due to my limited time, the Android, iOS, and browser versions of the Control gallery will not be maintained. They should, theoretically, still work though.
- The 1.x version of FluentAvalonia (0.10.x Avalonia) is now deprecated. Please consider upgrading to Avalonia 11.0/FluentAvalonia 2.0 for the latest and greatest!

- Windows 7, 8/8.1 are not supported by FluentAvalonia. It may still be possible to run on these versions of Windows, but no support for issues will be given.


## Avalonia minimum requirements
